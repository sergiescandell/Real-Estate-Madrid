# <center> Real Estate Insights: Real Estate Data Analysis in Madrid</center>

This project aims to analyze a dataset published by Idealista, a real estate portal with presence in Spain, Andorra, Italy and Portugal. We will focus on the city of Madrid, exploring the information about properties for sale and applying SQL techniques to extract key insights about the real estate market.

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset includes detailed information about the properties, such as:

 - Geographical location (latitude and longitude).
 - Total price and price per square meter
 - Built area and number of bedrooms/bathrooms
 - Additional features (terrace, elevator, air conditioning, swimming pool, garden, etc.)
 - Year of construction and cadastral data
 - Distances to points of interest (city center, subway stations, etc.)

An additional table is also available with information on the real estate agencies managing the properties, including their name and average rating.

## **Project Objectives**

Through SQL queries, we seek to answer key questions about the real estate market, such as:

✅ Properties with specific features (bathrooms, elevator, parking space, etc.).
✅ Average price analysis by features and locations.
✅ Identification of trends in property values in 2018.
✅ Comparison of prices by parking space availability.
✅ Analysis of real estate agency performance.

## **Technologies Used**
- SQL for data management and analysis
- MySQL (depending on the database used)
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive documentation
